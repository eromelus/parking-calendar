# Parking Calendar App

This is a **Next.js** application that connects to a **WooCommerce API** to display a calendar of parking lot bookings for cruises at Jacksonville Port (JAXPORT).  
It forecasts daily occupancy based on cruise durations, with color-coded levels:

- ðŸŸ© Green: 0â€“57 cars (low)
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: 58â€“92 cars (medium)
- ðŸŸ¥ Red: 93â€“115 cars (high)

Clicking on a date logs customer details to the console (expandable to a UI).

  - Delivery dates via `_prdd_lite_date` meta field
  - Cruise durations (e.g., `"5-Night"`) to forecast parking occupancy
